# Temperature & Humidity Sensing Using Arduino Uno and DHT 11 Sensor
Author : Sohel Datta

The project involves utilizing an Arduino microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor to measure and display real-time temperature and humidity data. 

The project aims to create a cost-effective and reliable solution for monitoring environmental conditions. 

The DHT11 sensor is a low-cost digital sensor that accurately measures temperature and humidity. 

It features a built-in capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor for temperature sensing. 

The sensor is connected to the Arduino microcontroller using digital communication protocols.

**Components Required**

<br>

1. Arduino Uno: The microcontroller that will process the data from the DHT11 sensor.

2. DHT11 Sensor: A digital sensor capable of measuring temperature in the range of 0°C to 50°C with an accuracy of ±2°C, and humidity from 20% to 80% with an accuracy of ±5% RH.

3. Jumper Wires: For connecting the DHT11 sensor to the Arduino.

4. Breadboard (optional): For organizing connections.
