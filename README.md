# Temperature & Humidity Sensing Using Arduino Uno and DHT 11 Sensor
Author : Sohel Datta

The project involves utilizing an Arduino microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor to measure and display real-time temperature and humidity data. 

The project aims to create a cost-effective and reliable solution for monitoring environmental conditions. 

The DHT11 sensor is a low-cost digital sensor that accurately measures temperature and humidity. 

It features a built-in capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor for temperature sensing. 

The sensor is connected to the Arduino microcontroller using digital communication protocols.
